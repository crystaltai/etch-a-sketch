## Summary

### What I learned

- Generating a grid of cells through JS, within an HTML container
  - Using nested for loops to create child elements in a grid-like fashion and appending them to the container
- Grabbing collection of elements within a container, and looping through to add Event Listeners to really help clean up code and avoid copying and pasting same lines multiple times
- Creating more complex shapes (toy console) with CSS
- Breaking down and organizing functions to focus on one logic

- The toy inclues different features:
  - Pixel Size: User can change the size of the pixels (grid cells) from small, medium and large
